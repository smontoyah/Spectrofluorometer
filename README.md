# Spectrofluorometer

This project involves the development of a portable spectrofluorimetry instrument for hydrocarbon prospecting applications. The system comprises a spectrometer chip, a data acquisition system, and an ultraviolet laser system for sample excitation. A proof of concept is designed and implemented, which will undergo various quality control tests, including calibration, laser diode lifespan, and performance in harsh environments such as open fields with high temperature and humidity. Simultaneously, a usage protocol is being developed.
